# Virtual Workshop on Data Science and Cyberinfrastructure for Post-Natural Disaster Water Researchers
## Developed for Networks in North Carolina and Puerto Rico

This workshop was developed as part of a project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to improve the collection and sharing of water and water quality data after a natural disaster. The project also includes supporting goals to improve local capacity to collect and share data and to enhance the networks, research, regulatory, management, who either create or otherwise use data of these types.
