### Activity
1. Introduction to GitHub review (slides recount pre-session homework)
2. Q&A (large group or break-out groups) to reflect on pre-session tutorials and/or prior experience using GitHub (collaborative “sticky note” Google Slides here?)
* What is confusing?
* Do you have an example of how prior or current work could utilize GitHub?
* What do you see as challenging?
* What seems beneficial?
3. Demonstration that walks through an example for sharing and accessing information in a GitHub repository
* This could be linked to a Hydroshare example (either in this module or later?)

Use collaborative [“sticky note” Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yqnIilLhTc7FHgOONXvRMpHyZLhK83agvFa8VFtzlug/edit?usp=sharing) for break-out group
