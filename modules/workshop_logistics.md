## Workshop Format
### Pre-Session Homework
* The workshop will operate with a small set of pre-workshop "homework" activities. These activities may include watching a short video presentation, readings, and/or a 'do-it-yourself' (DIY) effort.
* It will be important for your success and for the overall success of the workshop for you to complete these activities prior to the session.
* During the session, there will be limited presentations, but plenty of time built in to ask questions about the homework
### Workshop Sessions
