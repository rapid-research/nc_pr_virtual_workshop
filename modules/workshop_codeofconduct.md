# Code of Conduct  

***  

Workshop organizers are dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone. Regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age or religion, all participants are expected to respect each other as SCIENCE-MOTIVATED HUMANS first. Workshop volunteers and organizers will step up to address harassment of participants and/or presenters in any form if we are direct witnesses. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. We expect participants to act in ways that support a learning community at all workshop events and event-related social activities. And we expect you to support collaboration and learning while visiting workshop-related communities of practice. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Workshop organizers will contact workshop  participants violating the stated code of conduct, including being expelled from the workshop at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion.
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour
