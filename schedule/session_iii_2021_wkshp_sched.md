### Notes 
What elements are needed to create a thriving RAPID network? 
E.g., collaboration platform, staff coordinator, data repository and publishing?
Who would like to join a team for a proposal to NSF?
What are the next steps; how to rely on each other?
Networking within disciplines
Create an email listserv, Slack group, LinkedIn group, or Facebook group?
